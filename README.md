# Lsys

This is just a little exercise on C++ programming for sequential algorythms. 

The goal was to get used to the language by making a very basic prototype of a sign-up/log-in/check-in system with some aditional features, nothing too fancy, since the idea behind it were to be able to build it without further knowledge of the language. 
It's designed to run and be operated in a terminal.
